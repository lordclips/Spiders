I'm considering this my list of things not actually seen in the public repo.

This uses the Discord.py Python API wrapper for Discord bots and includes use of both JSON and TinyDB for storage.

I'll be migrating all storage to TinyDB inside of a master store and see how that goes, changing if I need to later.

Uses the Black python code formatter.
